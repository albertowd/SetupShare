# SetupShare
A simple App for sharing setups within Assetto Corsa sessions.

The app works on saved Setups/Pit Strategies used by your car in your track in the session. You can only download setups from other drivers in the session that are using the same car as you and has uploaded their setups already. The server holds the user setup for 24h, then it will be deleted.
