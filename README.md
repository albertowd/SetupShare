# Setup Share
A simple App for sharing setups within Assetto Corsa sessions.

## App

The app works on saved Setups/Pit Strategies used by your car and track in the current session (online or single player). You can only download setups from other drivers in the session that are using the same car as you and already uploaded one setup.

### App Install

First unzip the release content direct on your assetto corsa main folder (C:/Program Files (x86)/steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa) and load the game.
Select the option menu and the general sub menu. In the UI Module section will be listed this app to be checked.
Last step is to enter a session and select it on the right app bar to see it on screen.

## Web

The [page](http://albertowd.com.br/setupshare/) shows all the uploaded setups, use the search filter to find and download one (.ini and .sp, if available). Uploads are only allowed through the app.
